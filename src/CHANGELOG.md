# THIS VERSION IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH PREVIOUS WORLD SAVES

Note From Dev: 
"To be honest, i'm not to happy with this development build. My time available to develop the mod
has been very slim with having to work extra time to keep up with bills and also being a stand-in
teacher for my 3rd grade & 6th grade pre-AP children 6 days out of the week. There are a lot of
things within the mod that need heavy revision and need to be more defined"

[Added]
- Trappist1 C & E
- New overworld ores that should be more useful
- Alloy Refinery & Metal Furnace
- More recipes for decoration blocks


[Removed]
